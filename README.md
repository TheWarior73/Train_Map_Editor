# How to use

Run the app.py script\
(should have all the other scripts in the directory too for now)

# Purpose
I am developing and supporting this editor to enable myself and other users to create and edit train network maps.

It will be similar to the `Tenessine Metro MapMaker`, but with for addition more liberty because I felt too restricted when toying with it.
I want more flexibility in where I can display my station names, types, fonts sizes, legend display etc.

# Planned Features
I am planning on adding the following features to the train map editor:
- Loading/Saving network map
- Being able to edit the map
- Being able to create a map
- Being able to change map style easily (TBD if set styles or if custom)
- Let the user be as free as possible with their map
- Add some tools to help building the map
- A proper GUI and toolbars etc.
